=================

A spritesheet rendering plugin for Blender.

## What it does

Renders the scene from multiple directions and saves the results as separate files.

Multiple frames can be rendered. The animation frame range is read from the regular
`Start Frame` and `End Frame` rendering properties.

## Usage

Set your camera (called `Camera`) to track an object placed at the origo.
The "front" direction is the same as Blender's front view, so in other words your model
should face to the negative y direction.

> To point the camera towards an object, you can select the camera, add a Track To constraint to it (constraints can be added in the Constraints tab), choose the object in the Target field, -Z in the To field, and Y in the Up field.

Place your camera to the distance and height you'd like it to render the object from.

See `Sprite Batch Rendering` section of the `Render`-tab for controls. You can see the rendering status messages in the system console (Window > Toggle System Console). Click **Render Batch** to begin rendering.

Note: **the rendering process can't be canceled** once started, so make sure your `Frame Range` and image resolution are correct.

### Example .blend file
[http://www.lofibucket.com/blender/monkeeh.blend](monkeeh.blend) is an example how to set up the scene for sprite rendering.

The setup is the following:
* Camera is set to track the Suzanne mesh
* Camera projection is set to projection mode
* Scene render size is set to 128x128
* Frame range has been set to 1-1

### Path format

Output path must be of format

	C:/some/path/sprite%s%s.png

where `%s` and `%s` will be replaced by frame name and rotation step respectively.

### Step names
When rendering ZDoom compatible sprites, the following naming schemes need to be used.

* 8 steps, set step names to `12345678` (default)
* 16 steps, set step names to `192A3B4C5D6E7F8G`
